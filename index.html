    <p>Washington, D.C., Nov. 23, 2024 — Whytni Kernodle</p>

     <p>Black women are at the epicenter of America’s wage inequality crisis, according to a 2024 report by the National Women’s Law Center.</p>

<div style="min-height:371px" id="datawrapper-vis-aTfBI"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aTfBI/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-aTfBI"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aTfBI/full.png" alt="Over a 40-year career, Black women lose hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars compared to White, non-Hispanic men, highlighting the long-term impact of wage inequality. A Black woman with a professional degree will lose almost 2.5 million dollars compared to similarly educated white, non-Hispanic men." /></noscript></div>

    <p>Earning just 67 cents for every dollar paid to white men. Black women face a lifetime wage gap of up to $2.4 million USD. This disparity worsens for those with advanced degrees, underscoring systemic barriers that no level of education can erase.</p>

    <p>Despite being overrepresented in essential roles like healthcare and education, Black women are still funneled into low-paying jobs. "It’s a vicious cycle," says finacial analysis Elle Theodore. "We can’t build wealth if we’re constantly undervalued."</p>

    <p>The data highlights an uncomfortable truth: Black women, who are often the backbone of their families and communities, must navigate a system that undervalues their labor and sacrifices.</p>

    <p>Black women shoulder not only wage gaps but also disproportionate caregiving and economic instability, according to Theodore.  "This isn’t just about dollars lost—it’s about a legacy of missed opportunities, stolen potential, and the question of how a nation can thrive while sidelining those who contribute so much to its success.</p>
